Hello there $name !

Did the idea of a live multiplayer Mario Maker every crossed your mind? Introducing MakerKing! An indie platformer made with the heart of a single dev and a lot of inspiration from Mario Maker!

Restart from checkpoint? No level size limit? Watch WR in game? We've got that! On the plus side, the game is fully multiplayer and you can customize your character. Not convinced yet? We even have our own kaizo-like advanced tech.

But we need your help! The pitfall of any community game is... the lack of community! Don't get me wrong, we built a lot of levels for you to play but you have no idea how much you can make us grow with a single stream!

We could say that MakerKing has been "built for stream" as its multiplayer mode makes it really fun to play with your viewers. Don't hesitate, give it a try and you won't regret it. ;)
