				<h2>Jumpaï : Initial Press Kit</h2>
				<p>
					Welcome to Jumpaï’s press kit. On this page you should find any info you need to post articles or to learn
					about Jumpaï. If you need any additional information let us know and we will make it available.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>
					<!-- Create -->
					<!-- Share -->
					<!-- Compete -->
					Jumpaï is a platformer where you get to create levels and share them online to play with others. By igniting a
					community rather than a telling story, we aim to be a vessel of expression coming from both level creation and
					player customization. Level creation is made extra easy, so that anyone can create the level they imagined. As
					the community grows, players are free to play from a constantly growing source of tricky puzzles, hard
					platforming challenges, funny trolls or relaxing adventures.
				</p>
				
				<h2>Features</h2>
				
				<ul class="feature-list">
					<li><b>Over 30 Fun and Unique Items</b>
						<br/>
						With over 30 items that interact with each other in different ways, you will never run out of ideas when it
						comes to level creation. An example is the iconic frisbee can be picked up and thrown by the player to be
						jumped on or used to trigger switches that can turn off conveyors and electric barriers. Another example
						would be the fan which can be used both to help the player get higher with their umbrella or as a deadly
						trap to push away from the stage any player wearing a bubble.
					</li>
					<li><b>
						Fully-Integrated Level Editor</b>
						<br/>
						Transform your idea into a playable level from a level editor packed with content creation tools. The editor
						can be used to create your own levels or open up any other level.
					</li>
					<li><b>
						Race mode</b>
						<br/>
						Compete in real-time with your friends to see who can finish the level first! You can invite your friends to
						race against you. In this game mode, you will all start the level at the same time!
					</li>
					<li><b>
						Level browsing & Stars</b>
						<br/>
						Browse the top rated levels easily from anywhere in the game! The best levels naturally come up to the top
						as players leave stars to the levels they like. The game distinguishes between finished and unfinished
						creations, preventing the annoyance of playing an unfinished level without knowing it!
					</li>
					<li><b>
						Biomes</b>
						<br/>
						Select your biome as you create your level, using a brush to paint biomes however you want and make cool
						transitions. Biomes not only change the background, but also the decorations used in the level, giving
						access to a wider range of items allowing for unique styles.
					</li>
					<li><b>
						Controller Support</b>
						<br/>
						All controls are bindable, including ones for the editor!
					</li>
					<li><b>
						Leaderboards & Stats</b>
						<br/>
						Try to increase your score by getting top positions on leaderboards of popular levels!
					</li>
					<li><b>
						Player Customization</b>
						<br/>
						Give a unique look to your character to create your own in-game identity!
					</li>
					<li><b>
						Replays</b>
						<br/>
						Watch the world record replays to see how they finish so fast! Any replays can be watched from the
						leaderboard and you can even export them to make a video if you want to show your skills!
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>History</h2>
				<p>
					Originally named “Social Platformer”, the project started as a hobby in late 2016. Inspiration for Jumpaï came
					from watching my favourite Mario Maker streamers. I kept track of the constructive criticism they had for that
					game as I was making my own. Many wonderful ideas such as jumping off frisbees and having snappy bear traps
					came from unintended uses of Mario Maker’s game elements. Being experienced with computer network systems and
					enjoying the MMO feel in general, I decided to make multiplayer one of the core components of Jumpaï. As time
					went by, programmer assets got replaced by art from a professional and new features made the game more
					attractive in general.
